Since the widespread use of antibiotics almost a century ago, acute bacterial
infections have largely been largely superseeded by chronic inflammation as a
prominent cause of morbidity and mortality. Ulcerative colitis is a form of
inflammation of the lower intestine, which may ultimately lead to colon
cancers. 
The prevalence of these conditions in Western and Westernized population
attributes disease risk to a mesh of genetic predispositions, enviroment or diet. 
While the exact triggers are still unknown, and may not be unique, gut bacteria are
though to be primary suspects in these case.

To get an early snapshot of the scene, our study led by dr. Melanie Schirmer
examined pediatric UC patients, aged 4-17. The subjects have not undergone
treatment, potentially promising a less obstructed view into onset of inflammation.
Through investigation of paired stool and blood, we provide insights into bacterial
communities and their chemical repertoire that characterizes ulcerative colitis
at its earliest stages.

Various practices for exploring microbial compositions exist.  We opted for
<i>de novo assembly</i>, which takes bits and pieces of microbial DNA and
reconstruct bacterial and even viral genomes, even if most these microbes have
previously been unknown.  As opposed to using known bacterial genome catalogs,
this approach makes it harder to compare bacterial strains between studies, but
has greater sensitivity due to thorough utilization of the collected material.

Inflammation at mucosal sites is characterized by <b>low oxygen
availability</b>, prompting cells to switch from respiration to alternative
metabolic pathways.  These typically produce less energy per unit of sugar and
result in accumulation of metabolic waste products such as lactic acid. Similar
conditions arise during intensive exercise, where demands for oxygen skyrocket,
potentially leading to hypoxia.

Patients with most severe inflammation harboured bacteria with special
metabolic tricks up their collective sleeves. Most prominent of those was
Veillonella parvula, which typically resides in the oral cavity but tends to
relocate to the gut when inflammatory conditions <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36138166/">favor its colonization</a>. V.
parvula is particularly suited to inflamed conditions, as it can utilize
nitrate (NO3-) as an alternative to oxygen for respiration.  Besides, lactic
acid is one of its favourite nutrients, using it as a source of carbon. It is
no surprise that Veillonella is also found in high abundances in <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235964/"> marathon runners</a>. 

Subjects with Veillonella were also more likely to undergo colectomy, 
a surgery to treat the inflamed colon. However, the jury is still out on 
whether V. parvula is a mere sign of inflammation or contributes to disease
exacerbation. 

To address these questions, we cultured Veillonella in a dish and analyzed the
molecules it makes in conditions similar to the inflamed gut.  Besides lactic
acid, it likes to consume dipeptides - debris from proteins that tend to be <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35087228/"> abundant in inflammation</a>.
We observed the emergence of numerous molecules associated with disease
progression, including immunomodulatory metabolite indolelactic acid which may
result from tryptophan-rich diet.  We also detected lipids which can signal to
sensory neurons (oleamide) and contribute to <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05525-z"> exercise
motivation</a> .  Interestingly, we also found genes in Veillonella that help
it meddle with thiopurines, molecules that are similar to immunosuppresive
drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. 

In summary, we seen how a microbe particularly tailored to live in inflamed
guts characterizes disease states and produces bioactive molecules.  Related
nitrate addicts, such as <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, have previously been
established as causative disease agents and are now targeted by <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35931020/"> phage therapies</a>. As
inflammatory bowel disease seem to be mosaic of enviromental exposures
identification of novel microbes and molecules aids diagnosis, therapeutic
targets and recommendations.
