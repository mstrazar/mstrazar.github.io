Snowball
Thriving.

* UC: inflammation of the colon
Newly diagnosed

Highlights:

* Microbial species in IBD severity. 
	Moderate/severe, mild, inactive.
		respiration through sulfate or nitrate as electron acceptors
	Oral translocation ***
	bacteria typical for the oral cavities
* Chemical repertoire in stool/plasma
	Metabolic diversity. **
	Dipeptides. Trp metabolism. AhR receptor.
* Culturomics *** 
	* Conditions mimicking inflammation, nitrate, lactate. 
		Together they mimick profiles in inflammation best. 
		lactate, Veillonella’s preferred carbon source
	* Alignment between metabolic profiles.
		Lipids signal strongest (disruption of cell membranes), endocannabinoid receptors.
* metabolizes immunosuppressive thiopurine

purines can be dietary or parts of nucleic acids

drugs through xdhA xanthine dehydrogenase
 nitrate signals this modality

6-mercaptopurine
azathioprine

CB1 receptor
	GPCR
	expressed in brain and periphery
	antagonists can ameliorate inflammation
	calcium channels, PKA, PKC

peripheral CB1 signalling on exercise was mediated by dopamine

Veillonella enriched in exercise (Kostic).





Why is nitrate enriched? Low-oxygen, "hypoxia".
Lactate.
	" emergence of new electron acceptors that enable anaerobic respiration."


Fermentation is a non-membrane chemical breakdown of sugars (from pyruvate, which comes from glycolysis) to produce a tiny amount of ATP. 

Mammalian cells start to behave more like yeasts.
Bacteria then find other ways to survive in low-oxygen environments.
O2, nitrate, sulfate, CO2, fumarate.

Inflammation reduces glycolysis.
Hypoxia can induce inflammation
Oxygen gradients through the intestine that induce inflammation.
Lipids, endocannabinoid receptors.
