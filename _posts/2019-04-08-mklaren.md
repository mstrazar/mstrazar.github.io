<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">Kernel methods</a> are a fairly mature branch of machine learning,
but are heavily used in e.g. bioinformatics or time series modelling. Our latest contribution
describes how learning with multiple kernel functions (representations)
can be implemented in an efficient way.
The latest <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219302449">Neurocomputing issue</a>
features our paper <i>Approximate multiple kernel learning with least-angle regression</i> in open access, describing
the design and various applications of the <i>Mklaren</i> algorithm. Highlights:

<ul>
<li> Efficient kernel selection in linear regression, </li>
<li> competitive performance among kernel approximation methods, </li>
<li> blueprint for applications in time series modelling, text mining and biological sequence regression, </li>
<li> perhaps most importantly, comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/mstrazar/mklaren">Mklaren Python library</a>.
    It implements several kernel approximation and multiple kernel learning methods
    in a memory-efficient way.</li>
</ul>


Big thanks to my advisor and colleague
