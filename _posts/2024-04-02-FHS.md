Non-communicable diseases are ravaging the healthcare systems in much of the
northern hemisphere and beyond. Cardiovascular disease can often be linked to
host lipid levels, where cholesterol plays a key role in fat digestion, cell
growth and signaling. Hypercholesterolemia - high cholesterol levels - is
also associated with buildup of plaques and is detected in 30 - 45
% of heart attacks.

There is a years-long pursuit for potential cholesterol lowering bacteria
(probiotics), which has so far yielded mixed results in left the underlying
mechanisms open to interpretation.  Much of the work started by noticing that
consumption of fermented foods (e.g. yogurt) lead to decreased serum
cholesterol levels, hinting that bacteria in those products do something
useful.  One mechanism that aligned with these observations was bacterial
metabolism of bile acids, which triggers the host to dig in cholesterol
reserves to replenish this pool. More recently, bacteria with direct
cholesterol metabolizing capabilities have been found, although their abundance
in humans was unknown.

Framingham Heart Study is a multi-generational patient tracking effort, which
started in 1948, now in its third generation and counting. Originally
designated to stady the onset of cardiovascular disease, it is powered to
provide detailed insights into onsets of different disease and ailments. The
latest published data included bacterial and metabolite profiles combined with
diverse vitals. 

With <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenhao-li-1b695b99/">Chenhao Li</a>
and the team, we had the opportunity to delve into large-scale analyses of
patient data, which revealed that intestinal cholesterol could be related to
better CVD indicators, including blood glucose and triglyceride levels. These
were in turn heavily associated with host gut bacterial abundances.

Among other things, we noted several microbes with the potential of passing
dietary compounds (cholines, carnitines), characteristic for diets rich in red meants, 
down the trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) pathway, a known cause of atherosclerosis and 
thrombosis.

Combined with screening of metabolite profiles allowed us to seek bacteria
which may be related to reduced cholesterol levels. 

As there may be many reasons for decrease cholesterol levels, the high
"statistical power" (size of the cohort) promises robust identification of
causal factors. Indeed, we found Eubacterium, a low abundant bacterium known to
convert cholesterol to products that are easier to excrete from the system, as
shown in a previous study from our group. The stand out bacteria though were
Oscillibacter, which had 26 representative species and was present at very high
levels, reaching up to 1 in 100 bacteria in some individuals. This presented
promising early evidence that Oscillibacter might have to do with decreased
cholesterol levels. 

Digging through the freezers containing hundreds of bacteria in our isolate
collection, early experiments showed that Oscillibacter can assimilate fluorescent
cholesterol, which can be seen shining within the bacteria on the image above.

To shed even more light on the mechanisms for cholesterol metabolism in
Oscillibacter, we turned to recent artificial intelligence methods, which have
recently redefined the protein search field.  As microorganism evolve, they
chop and change proteins so fast that they may become unrecognizable by amino
acid sequence comparison methods. Rather, searching for retained protein
structures is more adept to identification of conserved functions.  

Searching for several ways cholesterol can be metabolized, we identified
several, but not all enzymes in cholesterol excretion pathway. Interestingly,
when Oscillibacter was found together with Eubacterium, the association with
lower cholesterol was even stronger, hinting at potential cooperative effects.

Oscillibacter turned out to have more in its locker, including modifying
cholesterol by decorating it with sugars, a mechanism that stomach bacteria use
to survive in that hostile environment. 

Narrowing down from modern metagenomics approaches, we also resorted to more
classical bacterial isolation and culturing from patient samples. DNA
sequencing confirmed that gut isolates from this exact cohort posses the
predicted tools for cholesterol metabolism. This effort also enabled us to
perform culture metabolomics, showing that the predicted cholesterol
derivatives indeed appear when bacteria are grown in a dish. 

Our journey down the cholesterol pathways in company of Oscillibacter is not
over yet. Animal model work is required to establish therapeutic potential of
these bacteria or their enzymes, with careful monitoring of colonization
efficiency, gene expression and circulating cholesterol levels. Dietary
context also matters, a lot. As the contemporary studies feed us with vast
amounts of precise information, this is an exciting time to act on 
bacterial fat digestion.
