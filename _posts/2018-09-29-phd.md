After a whirlwind five years at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana,
I have defended my PhD this Friday, on the topic of
<i>Low-rank matrix factorization in multiple kernel learning</i>. The book
is available <a href="http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/4258/">here</a>.

Here is the book cover, representing a fit of Istria's landscape using
low-rank kernel regression models.

There is also an <a href="/notebooks/phd/movie.htm">animation</a>,
showing the evolution of a least-angle regression (LAR) model.
