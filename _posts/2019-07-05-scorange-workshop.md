<p>The Swiss trade hub, Basel, scorching hot in July this time around, 
has hosted the ISMB/ECCB 2019 conference, a leading world forum in bioinformatics.</p>

<p>The ability to profile gene expressions at the single cell level has already revolutionized 
our understanding of immune systems, diseases such as cancers, and more. </p>

<p>Our team has presented Single-cell Orange, an analysis and visualization tool enabling 
highly interactive work with single-cell gene expression data. Efforts from the past year have culminated in an 
easy-to-use software that enables a surprisingly flexible exploratory data analysis, projections, clustering and 
gene marker discovery without coding! </p>

<figcaption> Interactivity turns scOrange’s workflows into an explorative data analysis tool. 
Shown is a simple workflow that loads the single-cell RNA sequencing data and displays it in the t-SNE plot.
