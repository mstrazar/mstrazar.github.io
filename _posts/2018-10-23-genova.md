Our flagship software for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
has made a debut this week at the
<a href="http://www.igst.it/nettab/2018/">Nettab 2018</a> conference hosted
in Genova, Italy.

The contemporary reproducibility crisis in science in general has
led to many initiatives to raise standards in data sharing and management.
<b>F</b>indability, <b>a</b>ccessibility, <b>i</b>nteroperability, and
<b>r</b>eusability (FAIR) is an instance of such an initiative, and
scOrange makes a strong case in ensuring these notions.
A more
detailed report on the trip can be found on scOrange official
<a href="https://singlecell.biolab.si">website</a>.

The birthplace of Christopher Columbus is in any case worth visiting by
itself, especially if one likes hiking, focaccias and architecture lessons
on an hourly basis.

In other news, we have witnessed the 0-0 draw in a Serie A match between
the home side UC Sampdoria and Sassuolo. The result did not flatter the
home side, which should have been 2-0 up by half time. Their
inefficient 4-3-1-2 formation with the full-back doing next to nothing certainly
did not help. Nevertheless, it was possible to learn many a swearword from
the home crowd.
