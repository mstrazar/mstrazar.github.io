Human breast milk, sometimes called the ultimate superfood, is a key source of
nutrients not only for the growing infant but also for its developing
microbiome. Indeed, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are complex sugars
indigestible by human enzymes and cater primarily to our bacterial friends.
Therefore, breastfeeding is important to ensure stable and healthy microbial
communities that contribute to digestion and immune system development.  

Although increasingly rare in modern societies, the World Health Organization
recommends breastfeeding for up to two years of age. It is therefore important
to understand how birth and feeding practices (food, delivery modes) affect the
infant gut microbiome and it's molecular repertoire in order to back up such
recommendations with data.  In a study featured in Cell, lead by Tommi Vatanen,
Qi Yan Ang, and Lea Siegwald, we analyze a large, longitudinal cohort of more
than 200 infants from Bangladesh, sampled for multiple times points and up to
two years after birth. As early months are exclusively fueled by breastfeeding,
the microbes are dominated by species from Bifidobacteria. Introduction of
solid foods is a major milestone in development, leading to the bloom of
another genus Prevotella, commonly associated with plant based diets.

Bifidobacteria play important roles in digestion of carbohydrates as well as
immune system development by producing molecules such as indolelactate. Here,
we precisely characterize subspecies of a common bacteria <i>Bifidobacterium
longum</i>. The period immediately after weaning was dominated by <i>B. longum infantis</i> and
the transition to solid foods lead to an increase in <i>B. longum longum</i>. The
transition between these two large communities happens through a newly
discovered clade, named <i>B. longum transitional</i>. Comparison of the strains in
three different ways (mutational analysis, metagenomics-assembled genomes and
culturing isolates) confirms that this three-clade structure always appears.

The genomes of <i>B. longum transitional</i> harbors the capabilities to digest both
human milk oligosaccharides (breastfeeding) as well as other complex glycans
associated with plant based diets, including wheat and legumes. The analyses
provide a clear example of how subspecies adaptation to changing environmental
regimes happens at the gene level and leads to selection of best adapted
subspecies. 

<i>B. longum transitional</i> also associates with increased levels on imidazole
propionic acid, which promotes <a

and pipecolic acid, a building block for many important secondary metabolites
such as <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article/33/6/401/5993023">immunosuppressants</a>,
which is predicted to be produced from dihydrodipicolinate synthase enzyme
found in this microbe. The rich trove of molecular data generated in this
study, including more that 2,000 paired metabolomics and metagenomics samples
promise further discoveries of important microbially-produced metabolites.

In summary, recommendations on birth practices have direct implications for
healthy development of our gut microbiota, as underlined by two additional
analyses in the study, showing how microbial compositions and levels of their
compounds (N-acetylglutamate, indolelactate) predict diarrheal episodes and
have marked effect on infant growth. The findings presented here are also an
important resource in probiotic and prebiotic design to promote or recover
microbial communities that work for us.
