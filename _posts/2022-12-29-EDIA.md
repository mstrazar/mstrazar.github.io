Humans provide room and board for thousands of bacterial species, most of them
renting the space in our guts. In exchange for a notable portion of
our food intake, they can help us metabolize hard-to-digest nutrients and keep
our immune systems in check. Our relationship with these guests is established
immediately at birth (and perhaps before), when some of the maternal bacteria
relocate into their newborn host. 

In our latest study, led by Tommi Vatanen and Eva Karolina Sjöberg Jabbar, we
investigated which bacteria make the journey, their dietary preferences and the
chemical compounds they produce. In a collaboration including institutes and
hospitals from Massachusetts, USA and Helsinki, Finland, 70 mother/baby pairs
were tracked for months before and after birth, measuring the bacteria and
compounds (metabolites) they both harbor. 

The infants start with a "blank slate" and rapidly accumulate bacteria, as
evidenced by increased diversity and the number of different compounds
increasing within the first 3 months of life. Levels of Eubacterium, Roseburia,
and Blautia correlate between mothers and their infants samples, suggesting
that these are the species likely to translocate. How the actual migration
happens is unclear and likely specific to individuals. Primarily, co-housed
household members tend to share similar gut bacteria, but direct transfer
through the placenta remains highly controversial.

The data revealed a striking phenomenon where maternal bacteria share
individual genes with infant microbes, rather than relocating themselves.  A
robust statistical analysis has shown that one can find 100% identical genes
shared between species A in the mother and some different, but related, species
B in the baby. Requiring strict identity between the two gene copies and the
low likelihood of finding such matches by chance (in unrelated mother/baby
pairs) corroborated this conclusion.

A very generous bacteria was <i>Bacteroides cellulosilyticus</i>, a prominent utilizer
of carbohydrates in breast milk which provided many genes to infant microbes
from the same microbial family. The ability to survive on milk sugars was one
of the most transferred functions, highlighting the importance of adaptation in
this dietary-restricted period. How and where this gene transfer happens is
still an open question, but evidence suggests multiple genetic editing
mechanisms in bacteria as well as the existence of "mediator" bacteria or
viruses (phages). 

It is intriguing to think whether bacterial families help "one of their own" to
survive in a very different and resource limited environment. This is seen by
an increased number of carbohydrate/microbe correlations after birth, a trend
which declines as the baby ages and she or her microbial community gets less
dependent on any one member.

Important implications of this study were marked differences affected by breast
milk and infant formula use, which directly affected bacterial and metabolite
compositions. Microbiomes in Westerners are more different than traditional
populations to begin with, an effect which is probably exacerbated by increased
formula use in recent years. Since our relationship with microbes has evolved
over millions of years, abrupt changes in dietary practices affect the lineup
of bacteria and their compounds our immune system gets to see. Indeed, diet
based on breast milk and different types of formula affected chemical
composition as well as immunological profiles of the infant blood. These data
are aligned with an unfortunate increase in  autoimmune disease with infant
formula use, noted in previous reports.

Medical and dietary patterns during pregnancy birth have important implications
not only on infants themselves, but also their microbial community. The latter
is an important factor during the first three years of life, a time when our
immune system undergoes a crucial educational phase.
