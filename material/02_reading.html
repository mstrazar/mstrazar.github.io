The following is a list of my recommended books which I find of general use for
computational modeling, bioinformatics, teaching or mere entertainment.


<h3>The Fundamentals</h3>

<p class="intro">Fundamental reading in terms of understanding the fields from the modern side of the
    spectrum of computer science.</p>

<p><b>Matrix Analysis and Linear Algebra </b> (Carl Meyer, 2000) -
What it says on the tin. Properties of vectors and matrices.</p>

<p><b>Matrix Computations</b> (Gene Golub and Charles van Loan, 1983) - 
Detailed implementation recipes for various algorithms for matrix decompositions
and approximations. </p>

<p><b>Introduction Functional Analysis with applications</b> (Erwin Kreyszig, 1978) -
Basic definitions from functional analysis; inner product-, metric-, normed-
and various more specific spaces, theory of operators, boundedness, etc.
Essential for understanding machine learning among other things.</p>

<p><b>Convex Optimization</b> (Stephen Boyd and Lieve Vanderberghe, 2004) -
Understanding mathematical optimization, building from the basic set theory and
vector spaces; Many optimization problems can be solved if written/approximated
as optimization over convex sets or optimization of convex functions.  Contains
the theory, algorithms and applications, and is complemented with well-made
video lectures on YouTube.</p>

<p><b> Introduction to algorithms</b> (Thomas Cormen et. al, 2001) - 
Perhaps a computer science one-oh-one book and a bible for any computer scientist or engineer.
It is probably not found on reading lists related to any kind modeling, but I nevertheless
find it useful especially for computational complexity analysis.</p>


<h3>Machine Learning and Statistics</h3>

<p class="intro">Books that satisfy some of my primary interests in machine learning, namely
    kernel methods and various algorithms based on matrix decompositions.</p>

<p><b> Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis </b> (John Shawe-Taylor and Nello
Cristianini, 2004) - I prefer this book to other books about kernel methods
because of right ratio between reader intuition and mathematical rigour. On top
of that, it starts from the very basics and carefully takes the reader
through the wonders of Hilbert spaces. Application-wise it contains little
material, but luckily the former is abundant in this nowadays very mature field.</p>

<p><b>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</b> (Chris Bishop, 2006) -
Machine learning models from a probabilistic (Bayesian statistics) perspective.
Contains little information on algorithms and applications, which I think is
good. More importantly, it provides intuition and derivation of different
models, with the right level of mathematical very rigor.  The exercises
complement the main content, with some having solutions on the web.  Especially
useful are chapters on Sampling methods and various latent variable models.
Less clear is the description of kernel methods and Gaussian processes, so I
would advise the reader to look elsewhere for these concrete topics.</p>


<h3>Bioinformatics / Computational Biology</h3>

<p class="intro">This heterogeneous field grows in a rather rapid, conference-driven manner.
The following books come to good use for teaching purposes and contain more
    computational/algorithmic aspects of bioinformatics/computational biology.</p>

<p> <b>Introduction to Computational Genomics</b> (Nello Cristianini and Matthew Hahn, 2006) - 
A very friendly book, split into self-contained chapters. Worth reading from
start to finish even if only for its well-written chapter introductions. The
go-to book for a beginner in the field. </p>

<p> <b>Biological Sequence Analysis</b> (Richard Durbin, 1998) - Sequence analysis
algorithms, presented with a higher degree of mathematical rigor and
foundations, especially the Hidden Markov models and clustering sections.</p>

<p> <b>Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms</b> (Pavel Pevzner and Neil Jones, 2004) -
Complements the above books with problems that are less data analysis oriented
and more bulk computation-type, such as genome assembly. At times written in a
cowboy style, which, judging by the cover, seems to be the authors favourite
outfit.</p>


<h3>Popular Science</h3>

<p><b>The Signal and the Noise: Why Most Predictions Fail but Some Don't</b> (Nate Silver, 2012) -
It reads like a collection of very detailed essays from one of the most famous
practitioners in data science. Contains absolutely zero maths, but
provides important intuition and very detailed examples of distinguishing
correlation from causation in fields such as economics, sports betting,
moneyball, gambling and even machine intelligence. </p>
<p class="quote">"A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can theoretically cause a tornado in
Texas. But in loosely the same way, a tsunami in Japan or a longshoreman’s
    strike in Long Beach can affect whether someone in Texas finds a job."</p>


<p><b>How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</b> (Jordan Ellenberg, 2014) -
A book that focuses on intuition, this time about mathematics in general and
how the mathematical thinking can improve daily lives. Examples like the US tax
system, sacrificing sheep, missing airplanes, and the questions existence of
god to point out how basic concepts like (non-)linearity, statistical
hypothesis testing, expectation, Bayesian inference manifest themselves in
practice.</p>
<p class="quote">"It’s easy to make arithmetic mistakes when doing a problem like this under
time pressure. And sometimes that leads to a student arriving at a ridiculous
result, like a jug of water whose weight is −4 grams.  If a student arrives at
−4 grams and writes, in a desperate, hurried hand, “I screwed up somewhere, but
I can’t find my mistake,” I give them half credit.  If they just write “−4g” at
the bottom of the page and circle it, they get zero—even if the entire
derivation was correct apart from a single misplaced digit somewhere halfway
down the page.  Working an integral or performing a linear regression is
something a computer can do quite effectively. Understanding whether the result
makes sense — or deciding whether the method is the right one to use in the first
place — requires a guiding human hand. When we teach mathematics we are supposed
to be explaining how to be that guide. A math course that fails to do so is
essentially training the student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft
Excel."</p>


<p><b>The Code Book</b> (Simon Singh, 2001)
- Beautiful overview of the history of cryptography from the Caesars Code, to
Enigma machine, to Public Key cryptography and the internet (a bit early for
blockchains and crypto-currencies, though).  Contains short, worked examples
for crypto-systems and how these evolved in parallel with statistics and
later computer systems, interleaved with contemporary military history.</p>
<p class="quote">"Now picture the following situation. As before, Alice wants to send an
intensely personal message to Bob. Again, she puts her secret message in an
iron box, padlocks it and sends it to Bob. When the box arrives, Bob adds his
own padlock and sends the box back to Alice. When Alice receives the box, it is
now secured by two padlocks. She removes her own padlock, leaving just Bob's
padlock to secure the box. Finally she sends the box back to Bob. And here is
the crucial difference: Bob can now open the box, because it is secured only
with his own padlock, to which he alone has the key."
</p>


<p><b>We Have No Idea</b> (Jorge Cham, 2017) - An introduction particle physics
and the theory of universe and everything, highlighting the various aspects of
the world we have no idea about. Despite the cartoon-like presentation (the
author is behind the webcomic <i>PhD comics</i>), it contains surprisingly
comprehensive treatment of relativity theory, dark matter, wormholes,
unperceivable extra dimensions and more.  </p>
<p class="quote"> "For example, if a baboon throws
a baseball very gently at your car, you would see the ball bounce off, and you
and the baboon might conclude that your car is one giant single
particle."</p>


<p><b>What If?</b> (Randal Munroe, 2014)
Scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions, written by former NASA
engineer, more famous for the webcomic XKCD. Makes for a perfect summer read.
We always wondered on questions like "From what height would you need to drop a
steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?", "What if a rainstorm
dropped all of its water in a single giant drop?" and of course, What would
happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of
light?"</p>
<p class="quote"> "Suppose you’re watching from a hilltop outside the city. The first thing you
would see would be a blinding light, far outshining the sun. This would
gradually fade over the course of a few seconds, and a growing fireball would
rise into a mushroom cloud. Then, with a great roar, the blast wave would
arrive, tearing up trees and shredding houses.  Everything within roughly a
mile of the park would be leveled, and a firestorm would engulf the surrounding
city. The baseball diamond, now a sizable crater, would be centered a few
hundred feet behind the former location of the backstop.  Major League Baseball
Rule 6.08(b) suggests that in this situation, the batter would be considered
“hit by pitch,” and would be eligible to advance to first base."</p>
