Hi, you've reached the home page of Martin Stra≈æar. I am a researcher in the fields of bioinformatics
and machine learning, and also fond of Slovenian and Mediterranean 
<a href="http://www.pandolo.si">traditional sports</a>.

The title of this page, <code>sin(x) = x</code>, symbolises the idea of approximating complicated worlds (in our case:
gene networks, protein-RNA interactions, housing prices) using approximate models (essentially, computing devices).
