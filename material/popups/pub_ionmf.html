<p><b>Post-hoc comparison of RNA-binding proteins based on iONMF.</b> (left)
Hierarchical clustering (Wardâ€™s linkage) of proteins and 20 most common complex
motifs, estimated from row vectors HKMER obtained with iONMF.  Heatmap shows
log odds ratios of observed motif probability in sites proximal to crosslinked
sites divided by the expected probability.  (right) Protein similarity based on
gene region types row vectors in HRG. For each region type, the interval
[-50..50] relative to the crosslinked sites is shown.  </p>
