<p><b>Experimental evaluation of kernel regression approximation models</b>.
Selected example of a time series fit with the exponentiated quadratic kernels
using different kernel (matrix) approximation models.  The predictions for each
model are compared to the test data points (in gray).  The locations of
selected inducing points are marked with triangles near the bottom edge (where
applicable).</p>
