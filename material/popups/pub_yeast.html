<p><b> The assembly of a multi-trait yeast cell factory.</b>The future yeast
cell factory strains will require combinations of several traits, each of which
will be encoded by a specific genetic module (depicted by strings of arrows)
engineered using the state-of-the-art synthetic biology approaches, such as
marker-free multiplex genome editing and orthogonal promoter libraries. In the
future, individual “ready-to-use” modules should become available for fast
transfer of the desired traits to the recipient strain in any combination. The
order in which the respective modules are introduced will depend upon the
specific conditions/requirements. Left Depending on the biotechnological
process, different robustness traits will have to be introduced into the
starting strain (e.g. tolerance to extreme pH, osmotic stress, organic acids or
other toxic substances). Following the isolation of strains with superior
performance with regard to specific traits (depicted by different colours),
causal genes can be identified by polygenic trait analysis and/or by
bioinformatics methods, as described in the text. Centre Optimization of the
strains for efficient utilization of renewable feedstocks is another important
aspect in engineering multi-trait yeast cell factories. Utilization of
pentoses, especially xylose, and in the future also of lignin, will enable more
cost effective production of biochemicals. The next generation of yeast cell
factories will be capable of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), as described in
the text. Right The biosynthesis pathway for the desired product could consist
of a number of endogenous and/or heterologous genes. These genes will be
combined with standard modules that will provide common building blocks or
contribute to cofactor balance (The image in B is a detail from Champs DSC01354
