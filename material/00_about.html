<p> You've reached the home page of Martin Stražar, PhD, a researcher in computational biology
and machine learning, currently based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p>

<p>My main topics of interest include computational method development in microbial genomics, metabolomics, host-microbe interactions and
biological sequences (RNA, proteins). </p>

<p>I am an unofficial ambassador of <a href="http://www.pandolo.si">Slovenian Pandolo federation</a> (Zveza društev igre Pandolo Slovenije),
a nonprofit custodian of Mediterranean traditional sports.</p>

<!--- <p> The title of this page symbolises the idea of approximating complicated realms
    using approximate models.</p>

<p> The blog will (for now) revolve around machine learning, bioinformatics,
    focusing on some technical aspects that are usually kept under the hood. </p>
