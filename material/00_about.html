You've reached the home page of Martin Stra≈æar, a researcher in the fields of bioinformatics
and machine learning, and also fond of Slovenian and Mediterranean
<a href="http://www.pandolo.si">traditional sports</a>.</p>

<p> The title of this page symbolises the idea of approximating complicated realms
    using approximate models.</p>

<p> The blog will (for now) revolve around machine learning, bioinformatics,
    focusing on some technical aspects that are usually kept under the hood. </p>
